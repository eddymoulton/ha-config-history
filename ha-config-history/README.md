# HA Config History

Git-like change history without git for Home Assistant

Create a timeline of changes to yaml (or any text file) configuration in Home Assistant with a diff viewer and restore capability.

## Features

- Watch monitored files for changes, saving a new backup immediately on file change
- Restore old versions from within Home Assistant (via Addon) 
- Compare any two versions of a configuration file with the built in diff viewer
- Configure backup options to track the usual Home Assistant configuration, or add any files you want
